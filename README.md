The Naive Bayes algorithm has a better accuracy of 66.67 compared to the SVM algorithm with an accuracy of 33.33. This means that the Naive Bayes algorithm is better at predicting the outcomes in the test data compared to the SVM algorithm.

The reason why Naive Bayes performed better in this scenario can be due to a variety of reasons such as:

The dataset size and structure, if the data has many features and is easy to interpret, Naive Bayes can be more effective.
The data distribution, Naive Bayes assumes that the features are independent, if the features in the data are not independent, the performance of Naive Bayes can decrease.
The accuracy of the model can also depend on the choice of hyperparameters, if the hyperparameters of the SVM algorithm were not optimized, this could result in a lower accuracy score.
It is important to keep in mind that accuracy is not the only evaluation metric that should be considered, other metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score should also be considered to get a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance.
